# Profemon
In this project, I applied object-oriented programming principles, including classes, enums, member functions, constructors, inheritance, and separate compilation. The goal was to create a Profémon battling system where Profémons can level up, learn skills, and trainers can form teams to compete.
Got it! Let's create a README file for your GitHub repository from the perspective of a student showcasing their work.

## Project Structure

- `profemon.hpp` and `profemon.cpp`: Implementation of the `Profemon` class.
- `skill.hpp` and `skill.cpp`: Implementation of the `Skill` class.
- `trainer.hpp` and `trainer.cpp`: Implementation of the `Trainer` class.
- `department.hpp` and `department.cpp`: Implementation of department classes (`MLDepartment`, `SoftwareDepartment`, `HardwareDepartment`).

## How to Compile

To compile the code locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
g++ skill.cpp profemon.cpp trainer.cpp department.cpp main.cpp -o profemon_game
```
## Notes

- I followed the project specifications and worked incrementally to ensure correctness.
- Testing was done extensively before submission.
